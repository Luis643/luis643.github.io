  After all the battles we faught together, after all the difficult times we saw together, after all the good and bad moments we've been through, I think it's time I let you know how I feel about you.
</p>

<p style="width:550px;">
  You complete my darkness with your light. I love:
</p>

<ul style="width:550px;">
  <li>the way you see good in the worse</li>
  <li>the way you handle emotionally difficult situations</li>
  <li>the way you look at Justice</li>
</ul>

<p style="width:550px;">
  I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over the time.
</p>
